# Podster

Podster is a *really* basic Podcast manager. 

It features:
- Adding and editing of podcast metadata.
- Hosting of the Podcast XML feed.

It deliberately does **not** feature:
- Storage and retrieval of music files; Heroku doesn't have a lot of space for music files, so you'll have to host them somewhere else like Dropbox.

## Get It

**Step 1.** Get yourself a [Heroku](heroku.com) account.

**Step 2.** Press this button:
